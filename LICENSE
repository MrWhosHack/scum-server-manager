Notes & clarifications:
- This license allows users to modify and redistribute the code for non-commercial purposes, and requires derivative works to be shared under the same license.
- It does not permit commercial distribution or selling of the software.
- Adding this license does not by itself prevent someone from falsely claiming authorship; the license requires attribution and preserving copyright notices. For stronger protections about authorship claims or trademarks, consider adding a trademark, contributor agreement, or a separate clause and consult a legal professional.

If you prefer a different legal model (for example, strong copyleft that allows commercial use like AGPLv3, or a custom non-commercial source-available license), tell me and I can replace this LICENSE with the chosen text.
